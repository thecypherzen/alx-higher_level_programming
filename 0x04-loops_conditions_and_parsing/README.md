# Overview #

The **Loops, conditions and parsing** project introduces very important devops concepts using bash, useful for server/data centre config, management and security. Its objectives are:
- Mastering how to create SSH keys.
- Understanding the advantage of using **#!/usr/bin/env bash** over **#!/bin/bash**.
- Understanding how to **while, until** and **for** loops.
- Mastering to use **if, else, elif** and **case** condition statements.
- Understanding how to use the **cut** command, and
- Knowing what are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them.
