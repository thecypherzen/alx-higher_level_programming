# Overview #

Afer completing the Javascript warm up exercise project: **0x12. JavaScript - Warm up** comes the **0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures** project. It does just what the name suggests - introduces Objects, scopes and closures. <br/><br/>I must say that one unique thing about ALX is the pace. In just two days, we're already looking at objects and closures! I had to read the article explaining closures two times and add a YouTube video just to understand that concept alone. <br/><br/>It's really fun doing hard things the ALX way.


### Learning Objectives ###
It's expected that at the end of this project, the following one should understand:
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to create an object in JavaScript
- What `this` means
- What `undefined` means
- Why the variable type and scope is important
- What is a closure
- What is a prototype
- How to inherit an object from another

### Dependencies ###
1. To successfuly execute js codes in the terminal, node.js ais required. To install, simply copy and paste these in your terminal:
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
	***As at the time of doing this project, node 14.x is deprecated and so I installed node20.x for the project. I don't think there would be any compatibility issues.***
2. It's also are requirement that all codes should be ***semistandard*** compliant, which could also be installed using this:
```
$ sudo npm install semistandard -g

```
