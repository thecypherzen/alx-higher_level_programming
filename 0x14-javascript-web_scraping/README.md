- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/node
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: AirBnB style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- You are not allowed to use var

### Resources ###
For reference sakes, I included the resources provided, in order to follow through the learning objectives and also refer to from time to time.

### Dependencies ###
1. Node 14
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

2. Semi-standard
[Docomentation](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)
```
sudo npm install semistandard --global

```
3. `request` module
***[Request](https://github.com/request/request) module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).***
```
sudo npm install request --global
export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
```
### Project Timeline Details ###
