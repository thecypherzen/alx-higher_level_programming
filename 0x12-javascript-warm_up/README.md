### Disclaimer ###
- Some of these are for references and CANNOT be mastered at one go.
- The resource linked to by ***Module patterns*** was somewhat confusing, as at writing this, but I'll grasp it in due course.

### Dependencies ###
1. To successfuly execute js codes in the terminal, node.js ais required. To install, simply copy and paste these in your terminal:
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
	***As at the time of doing this project, node 14.x is deprecated and so I installed node20.x for the project. I don't think there would be any compatibility issues.***
2. It's also are requirement that all codes should be ***semistandard*** compliant, which could also be installed using this:
```
$ sudo npm install semistandard -g

```
