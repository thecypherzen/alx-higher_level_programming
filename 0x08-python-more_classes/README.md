# Overview #

Diving deeper into the concept of Object Oriented Programming, this folder is all about the **Python - More Classes and Objects** project. I tried to apply Test Driven Development - using unittests, for practice and enhanced learning.

The files in root directory are required for fulfilling the requirements of the project. Non-required files are in respective directors, named accordingly.
