# Overview #

When this project came along, I was wondering what it was all about. Having gone through the materials provided (to a very large extent), I think I love the project. It introduces the concept of **Test Driven Development** and it's really interesting.

Now I have to learn to test my code before writing it. What a Marvel!

No doube therefore, that this directory contains files for the **Python - Test-driven development** project, in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the ALX_SE program.
