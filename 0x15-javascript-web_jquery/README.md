# Overview #

Using *JavaScript* is awesome, but with it, you get to write too many lines of code for pretty simple tasks like simple DOM Elements selection. It gets with other tasks like toggling classnames, event handling and animations. [JQuery](https://api.jquery.com/), as a JS Library, makes life easier, given that we're able to do much with shorter lines of code. The good thing is - it's small - and can be imported using it's cdn link!
